# GeoFRESH

GeoFRESH (geofresh.org) is a platform that helps freshwater researchers to process point data across the global river network by providing a set of spatial tools.

Follow the tutorial or upload your csv-table that contains geographic coordinates. GeoFRESH allows you to

- map your points,
- move points to the nearest stream network segment,
- delineate upstream catchments of each point,
- extract a suite of environmental attributes across the catchment,
- and download the data for further analyses.

GeoFRESH is based on the Hydrography90m stream network. For more information, please visit [hydrography.org](https://hydrography.org/).


For further analyses of your freshwater data, you can use the hydrographr R package that facilitates the download and data processing of the 
Hydrography90m data (publication in [Methods in Ecology and Evolution](https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.14226), 
[website](https://glowabio.github.io/hydrographr/) with details and examples, 
source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/glowabio/hydrographr/)).
